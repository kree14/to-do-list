# to-do-list
I've created a full-featured to-do list app with a modern, visually appealing design. Here's what it includes:
Core Features:

Add tasks: Type in the input field and click "Add Task" or press Enter
Mark as completed: Check the checkbox next to any task
Delete tasks: Click the red "Delete" button
Filter tasks: View All, Pending, or Completed tasks using the filter buttons

Additional Features:

Statistics dashboard: Shows total, completed, and pending task counts
Responsive design: Works well on different screen sizes
Smooth animations: Tasks slide in when added, with hover effects
Modern UI: Gradient backgrounds, glass morphism effects, and clean typography
Empty state messages: Helpful messages when no tasks are shown
Keyboard support: Press Enter to add tasks quickly

Data Storage:
The app uses in-memory storage with JavaScript objects, which means your tasks will persist during your current session. The data structure includes:

Task ID, text content, completion status
Creation and completion timestamps
Automatic ID generation for new tasks

The app is fully functional and ready to use! You can start adding tasks right away.
